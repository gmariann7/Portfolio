<hr>

  <p style="font-family:courier;"> My view of robotics before the start of this unit was that it was extremely intimidating and hard but now 
  I realize that it can be achievable through hard work. I was both excited and scared for the unit because it just seemed impossible that
  I could make the robot move. I'm actually really excited for the future with robots because the sky is the limit on what poeple could make.
  I'm especially excited about the self driving car because it could make traveling to be more efficient and relaxing. I'm nervous that all
  these innovations will make more lazy and not appreciate things as much because I think handmade things are also important. I think it
  really helps working with a partner because theres a lot of errors that could ruin an experiment. Next time I think I should go 
  more slowly and observe more because when yo go fast you can make a lot of tiny mistakes.</p>

  <hr>
 <p style="font-family:courier;"> My team worked really well on the light show. We both really liked the song we choose which made listening
   to it so many times easier.My partner and I both did the project on our computers and when we had a problem we worked with each other. 
   That allowed both of us to really get involved and learn as we each did the project. We maybe could have been on a more similar page on
   the note lengths for our blinking but we decided to just choose something in the middle as mine was too fast and hers too fast. The 
   basic pieces of every arduino sketch is that first you have to include any library you use to for the code. You also need to declare 
   the functions and set up your arduino to carry out your commands. The sketch name has to end in .ino for it to function properly.
