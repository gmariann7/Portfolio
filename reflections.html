<hr>

  <p style="font-family:courier;"> My view of robotics before the start of this unit was that it was extremely intimidating and hard but now 
  I realize that it can be achievable through hard work. I was both excited and scared for the unit because it just seemed impossible that
  I could make the robot move. I'm actually really excited for the future with robots because the sky is the limit on what poeple could make.
  I'm especially excited about the self driving car because it could make traveling to be more efficient and relaxing. I'm nervous that all
  these innovations will make more lazy and not appreciate things as much because I think handmade things are also important. I think it
  really helps working with a partner because theres a lot of errors that could ruin an experiment. Next time I think I should go 
  more slowly and observe more because when yo go fast you can make a lot of tiny mistakes.</p>
