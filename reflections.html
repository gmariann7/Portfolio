<hr>

  <p style="font-family:courier;"> My view of robotics before the start of this unit was that it was extremely intimidating and hard but now 
  I realize that it can be achievable through hard work. I was both excited and scared for the unit because it just seemed impossible that
  I could make the robot move. I'm actually really excited for the future with robots because the sky is the limit on what poeple could make.
  I'm especially excited about the self driving car because it could make traveling to be more efficient and relaxing. I'm nervous that all
  these innovations will make more lazy and not appreciate things as much because I think handmade things are also important. I think it
  really helps working with a partner because theres a lot of errors that could ruin an experiment. Next time I think I should go 
  more slowly and observe more because when yo go fast you can make a lot of tiny mistakes.</p>

  <hr>
 <p style="font-family:courier;"> My team worked really well on the light show. We both really liked the song we choose which made listening
   to it so many times easier.My partner and I both did the project on our computers and when we had a problem we worked with each other. 
   That allowed both of us to really get involved and learn as we each did the project. We maybe could have been on a more similar page on
   the note lengths for our blinking but we decided to just choose something in the middle as mine was too fast and hers too fast. The 
   basic pieces of every arduino sketch is that first you have to include any library you use to for the code. You also need to declare 
   the functions and set up your arduino to carry out your commands. The sketch name has to end in .ino for it to function properly. </p>

  <hr>
  <p style="font-family:courier;"> Everything I learned this week about circuits was completely new information as I had never learned about
    them before this week. It was very surprising how there was so many resources and websites that we could go on for help about circuits 
    but it was still very hard. I learned that the postive and negative positions of the pins were very important in actually allowing the
    function to happen. I liked the language we used for the arduino because it seemed much simpler then the other languages we have learned about. 
    My favorite part of the robot dance party was seeing the robots dance completely in sync with the robot at least for a few seconds and
    it made me so proud. It was actually pretty easy making it dance it was just very consuming figuring the exact durationit moved in a certain
    direction before it moved. </p>

  <hr>
  <p style="font-family:courier;"> A Model View Controller (MVC) is a pattern or framework that relates the user interface to the data models.
    The pattern is split into three categories which are the model, view, and controller. The model stores data, the view uses the user input 
    to display the data, and the controller controls the flow between the view and the model. A framework is a collection of libraries while 
    libraries are a collection of certain functions. Using a framework would be better then creating an app yourself because it is much more
    faster and efficient because having a framework allows you to not have to create everything. </p>

  <hr>
  <p style="font-family:courier;"> I would really love to finish the tutorial because there have been so many challenges for me in this turtoial
  and I just really want to get to the end. I want more practice on debugging because my computer had a lot of issues that weren't 
  really able to be resolved. I had two major problems that caused me to have to start all over and it was very frustrating but the tutorial
  defintely helped me learn a lot as I had to redo stuff over and over again. I still don't understand why I can't acess my website because 
  it can't find my file name because I had to change it to something else. At first it said that my file name was invalid so I changed it 
  but now it won't work because all the names are messed up. </p>

  <p style="background-color:rgb(0,0,0);color:white;font-size:22px;">Data</p>
  <hr>
  <p style="font-family:courier;"> Computers are good at data because they can store information much faster and efficiently.
  Also, computers don't have to manually put in data like humans but can automatically do it which cuts down on time and there is 
  a lesser chance of it making a mistake. An interesting fact about Michelle Lee is that she went to Stanford University and studied 
  human computer interaction.</p>

  <p style="background-color:rgb(0,0,0);color:white;font-size:22px;">Algorithms</p>
  <hr>
  <p style="font-family:courier;">I am most proud of being able to understand my assigned project idea because it seemed really 
  complicated at first. After reading and watching all the sources available to us and more though I understood the examples. The
  algorithm that was most interesting to me was Ray Tracing because it's used in movies and I love animation so it was fun learning about how 
  they make the characters look so realistic. She used data analytics for research for AT&T to improve customer satisfaction and
  the algorithms we learned about today made things much more efficient and faster. </p>
